# ImageGather.jl

This package implements image gather functions for seismic inversion and QC. We currently only implemented surface gathers via the double RTM method (put ref) for QC on inverted velocity models.

# Example

A simple example of surface image gather for a layered model can be found in `examples/layers_cig.jl`

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome.
