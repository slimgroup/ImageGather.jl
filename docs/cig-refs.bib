    abstract = { Common image gathers (CIGs) are classical tools for velocity analysis and for imaging enhancement procedures. Conventionally, this output is available after application of Kirchhoff-type migration algorithms to properly sorted cubes of seismic data (i.e. common-offset). In geologically complex areas, Kirchhoff migration has been replaced by wave-field extrapolation (WE) based depth migration algorithms, such as RTM and one-way WE migration, which produce superior quality images. However, computing the CIGs from WE migrations is not straightforward and still represents a challenge. In this paper we propose a new method to produce Surface Offset CIGs using a reverse time propagator. Note, however, that the proposed scheme does not depend on the particular implementation of WE method. Our intent is to benefit from a two-way wave-field propagation scheme which overcomes the limitation of the asymptotic assumption of ray-based methods, while sorting the output migrated cubes in the same way. As a consequence, we are able to produce CIGs in complex areas (sub-salt, complex overburden, etc.) somewhat closer to the ‘true’ offset gathers. Furthermore, we can replace ‘classical’ Kirchhoff offset gathers as input of most of the standard post-migration processing tools. Because of years of know-how in Kirchhoff type migrations, this method allows for an easier interpretation of migration’s results and, compared to the cost to obtain subsurface CIGs, less computational effort is required. Furthermore, these gathers are potentially suited for velocity model building. We provide the mathematical details of the method and we demonstrate its validity on synthetic examples. }

    abstract = "{The subsurface offset is a possible link connecting wave-equation migration methods, such as reverse-time migration, with the angle-domain. However, it describes an artificial reflection geometry that splits the reflection point between incident and scattered waves. The split configuration contradicts basic principles of continuum mechanics, as it represents action-at-a-distance, and has kinematics distinct from those of ordinary physical reflection. The angle-domain image, computed as a Radon transform of the subsurface offset image, implicitly inherits the split configuration, which distinguishes it from conventional angle-domain decomposition. As a consequence, it shows a dissimilar moveout response to erroneous migration velocity, but still carries valuable information about the migration velocity error.Conventional linearized traveltime inversion techniques, applied for velocity optimization, are most likely to fail while inverting angle-domain images produced from subsurface offset split reflections. These images should be labelled differently to highlight the split mechanism, and input to traveltime inversion algorithms only after a proper generalization. We present a modified linearized traveltime inversion formulation, appropriate for split reflections in the image space. The key ingredient in the algorithm is a subsurface offset depended extension of the traveltime change along migrated split reflection rays. A generalized reflection tomography scheme is proposed accordingly to tie imaging errors, in either the subsurface offset domain or its equivalent angle-domain map, to the migration velocity error.}",
